Hi!

My name is Jo√£o, I was born in Coimbra, Portugal.

I completed my integrated MSc degree in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Coimbra in 2009. I completed a PhD in Health Sciences in 2016 at the University of Coimbra, during which I was particularly interested in the application of machine learning techniques for the analysis of brain functional magnetic resonance imaging data (fMRI) in humans to decode visual perception. I have previous research experience in the application of multivariate computational tools for the analysis of genetic, electroencephalographic and neuroimaging data. I studied mainly brain structure and function in the context of health and disease. I do research in the area of visual neuroscience, neuroimaging and machine learning.

Outside neuroscience research my interests lie in sports in general, traveling, writing, geography and languages. I played rink hockey since I was 6 years old.

Feel free to send me a note about anything!
